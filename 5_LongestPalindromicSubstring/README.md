# NO.5 Longest Palindromic Substring
1. In python, creating two dimention list with '[[0]*m]*n', each sub list has the same address.
2. Dynamic programming and extension method have the same time complexity (O(n<sup>2</sup>)), but extension method uses O(1) space complexity with DP uses O(n<sup>2</sup>).
3. c++: str.substr(), python: str[n:m], c#:str.Substring().
